Based on your comprehensive dataset analysis, I can identify several critical patterns and provide targeted recommendations for improving your GNN performance. Let me break this down systematically:
🔍 Key Patterns Observed
1. Severe Label Noise Problem
Your analysis reveals extremely high disagreement rates across all datasets:
* Dataset A: 70.7% disagreement
* Dataset B: 74.5% disagreement
* Dataset C: 59.2% disagreement (best)
* Dataset D: 72.7% disagreement
This suggests significant label noise - likely 40-60% of your labels are incorrect, which aligns with the competition's focus on noisy label learning.
2. Class Imbalance Issues
* Dataset A: Class 2 (29.3%) vs Class 5 (6.6%) - 4.4x imbalance
* Dataset C: Class 2 (40.8%) vs Class 0 (5.2%) - 7.8x imbalance
* All datasets show similar severe imbalance patterns
3. Node Feature Poverty
All datasets have zero node features (data.x all zeros), forcing the model to rely purely on graph structure. This is a major limitation.
🚀 Targeted Improvement Strategies
Priority 1: Address Label Noise (Expected +15-25% accuracy)### Priority 2: Enhance Node Features (Expected +10-15% accuracy)### Priority 3: Handle Class Imbalance (Expected +5-10% accuracy)## 🔧 Complete Integration Strategy
Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:
1. IMMEDIATE (Week 1): Implement feature engineering

   * Replace add_zeros with the EnhancedGraphDataTransform
   * Expected improvement: +10-15% accuracy
   2. SHORT-TERM (Week 2): Add noise-robust training

      * Integrate the NoiseRobustTrainer pipeline
      * Start with GCE loss, then add sample selection
      * Expected improvement: +15-25% accuracy
      3. MEDIUM-TERM (Week 3): Handle class imbalance

         * Implement focal loss or weighted training
         * Expected improvement: +5-10% accuracy
Dataset-Specific Strategies:
Dataset C (Your best performer - 40.64% accuracy):
         * Focus on fine-tuning existing approach
         * Use it as validation for techniques before applying to others
         * Lower disagreement rate (59.2%) suggests cleaner labels
Dataset B (Worst performer - 23.61% accuracy):
         * Highest disagreement rate (74.5%) - prioritize noise-robust techniques
         * Smallest dataset (5,040 samples) - use aggressive augmentation
         * Consider transfer learning from Dataset C
Datasets A & D (Similar performance ~27-29%):
         * Large datasets - benefit most from advanced architectures
         * Use co-training between these similar datasets

	🎯 Additional Critical Recommendations
1. Model Architecture Refinements
         * Increase model capacity: Your current BasicGraphClassifier (64 hidden) is too small
         * Use your advanced GNN: The models_v5.py architecture is much better
         * Optimal hyperparameters for noisy data:
         * emb_dim=256 (increased from 128)
         * num_layer=4-5 (deeper for richer representations)
         * drop_ratio=0.3-0.4 (moderate dropout for noise robustness)
         * virtual_node=True (helps with information flow)
2. Training Strategy Improvements
         * Longer training: 50-100 epochs instead of 25
         * Learning rate scheduling: Cosine annealing or reduce on plateau
         * Early stopping: Based on validation performance to avoid overfitting on noise
         * Ensemble methods: Train 3-5 models with different seeds and average predictions
3. Data-Specific Optimizations
         * Cross-dataset validation: Use dataset C to validate techniques, then apply to others
         * Curriculum learning: Start training on high-confidence samples, gradually include harder examples
         * Test-time augmentation: Apply multiple augmentations at test time and average predictions
4. Competition-Specific Tactics
Since this appears to be a noisy label competition:
         * Submit multiple approaches: Different techniques work better on different datasets
         * Ensemble submissions: Combine predictions from different models
         * Meta-learning: Train a model to predict which samples are likely to be noisy
The most impactful change will be implementing the feature engineering pipeline - moving from zero features to rich structural features should give you an immediate and substantial boost. The noise-robust training will then help you effectively learn from the difficult, mislabeled data.
